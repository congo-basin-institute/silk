# Objectives

Preserve indigenous knowledge within the Baka community, and employ it as a novel and innovative educational and conservation tool.

## Project Objectives

To achieve these goals, the three-pronged objectives of the program will be:

### Objective 1: Collect and archive Baka traditional cultural expression

Provide community members with the practical skills and technical knowledge needed in the fields of cultural documentation, which would enable them to record, archive and manage access to their own cultural heritage. 

### Objective 2: Set up a village documentation center

Set up a documentation center equipped with low-cost, low-energy use computers powered by solar energy, where the community can access print and digital material. This will populate an existing museum structure with traditional musical instruments, tools, basketwork, and posters relating to traditional practices that serve as vehicles for culture.

### Objective 3: Promote cultural exchanges with other Baka villages

Enable exchanges with other Baka villages, to widen the pool of elders who can equip youth with skills and tek through traditional modes of transmission
