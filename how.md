# How?
## The Solution

With links to more details on:

- Courses, TEK + “scientific” knowledge
- Elder- younger, 
- Sc-Local Collab research projects 
– two-way exchange, trained parabiologists, trackers
(gain skills, employment, contrib to the mgt of their natres, understand need for conservation ➞ protect )

## Oral Tradition

In societies with few written sources of tradition, cultural expressions such as songs, stories and dances are used for intergenerational knowledge transfer. New technologies provide communities with fresh opportunities to document and digitize expressions of their traditional cultures, meeting the strong desire of the Baka to preserve, promote and pass on their cultural heritage to succeeding generations.

We will use participatory methods to ensure ownership by the community, but also to shift the focus from the resulting audio-visual products to the expression and recording process itself, focusing on what it means to the community and how they relate to the cultural resources they own. Secondary sources will be used to complement and guide these efforts.

Audio and video documentation would capture visual clues that can be crucial for interpretation (Snively & Corsiglia, 1998), and provide a non-textual format accessible by all members of the communities. The ease and flexibility of digital technology makes it possible to train the Baka to create their own documentation through participatory photo and video recordings, and can include multiple formats such as map-based and graphic interfaces (Mackenzie et al., 2017). Lastly, the digital format may also be more appealing to youth or others who may see traditional knowledge as old-fashioned (Twarog & Kapoor, 2004).
